TODO:

0. make hdevtools/type-info-just-str take a pos like everything else,
might require significant rewrite

0. Add customize.el settings for liquid-tip. Most importantly, allow user to
select the button lock binding.

0. One click install from MELPA, at most adding `(require 'liquid-tip)` to init.el.

0. ~~refactor/rewrite hdevtools.el~~ leave as liquid-hdevtools.el for now
